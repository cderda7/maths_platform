Deferred ideas, kept deliberately generous: if it came up and was not built, it goes here. Each
entry says where it came from and why it was deferred, so a later decision has its context.
Newest at the bottom of each section. Policy: every work session that scopes something out
appends it here (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Review pathways

- **Edit the pathway after creation.** Teacher changes the pipeline once students have started;
  students already past a removed stage keep their history, students not yet there follow the
  new shape. Deferred 2026-09-09: pathway is fixed at creation in v3.
- **"Continue tomorrow."** A pacing node on the pathway map: pause the class at the end of a
  stage and resume next lesson. Becomes meaningful once the pathway is editable after creation.
  Shown on the map now as a dashed, disabled node.
- **Explicit "end individual review now" and "end group review now"** teacher actions with the
  same one-minute grace as force submit. Deferred 2026-09-09: starting whole-class review already
  ends any stage.
- **Per-student pathway overrides** (a student who finished early goes to peers; a struggling
  student skips group). Not discussed in detail; noted as the natural next step once pathways
  exist.

## Whole-class review

- **"Follow along with me" rewrite mode.** Teacher says "class, write this down" and student
  screens unfreeze into a guided pad that mirrors the board. Deferred 2026-09-09 so the absolute
  freeze can be experienced first.
- **More views per problem slide.** v3 has two: unmarked, then marked (red and blue, no text).
  Deferred: an "examples hidden, predict first" view; the teacher's misconception note or the
  pattern clue shown under a red line; a correct/incorrect verdict badge per example.
- **Model-solution slide** after the examples.
- **Teacher live annotation / pen** over the projected examples.
- **Presenter view on a second device** (laptop or phone) showing names, notes, correctness and
  the next slide, with the board as a display-only mirror. Deferred: single projected window with
  a name-free control strip in v3.
- **Swap an example mid-session** from the presenter view without names reaching the projector.
- **Examples mirrored onto student screens** as a teacher toggle, so students can compare at
  their desk. Deferred: own work only, to keep the board the shared object of attention.
- **Tell the owner which letter is theirs** on their own frozen screen, as a toggle. Deferred:
  anonymous even to the owner, to avoid the "everyone looks at Sam" moment.
- **Class-level percentage variants**: per-subskill percentages, "n of m attempted", a footer
  for students matching none of the shown examples. Deferred: per-example "n/m students" only,
  denominator = students who handed in that problem.
- **Aggregate on the frozen student screen** (e.g. how many classmates share my approach).
- **Board slide for not-attempted students** or a prompt for them to attempt live.
- **Auto-record which examples were discussed** into the teacher's report for the lesson.

## Feedback and review design

- **Where else the red and blue step marks belong.** v3 removes red marks and per-problem slip
  counts from the student feedback screen and hides blue standouts there, because student-led
  review is now the whole individual stage. Their one student-facing placement in v3 is the
  whole-class *marked* view: the board shows marks on the anonymous examples and, at the same
  moment, each student's frozen screen shows marks on their own work. The user wants to expand on
  this (2026-09-09): candidates are the final report, the history view after whole-class review,
  a teacher toggle to reveal marks after individual review, and pathways without whole-class
  review that currently never show the student any marks.
- **"Still wrong or worse" detection on originally-wrong problems.** The v3 guard fires only when
  a correct problem is broken. Extending it to "your fix is also wrong" or "your fix is worse
  than the original" is a distinct design: it risks leaking where the mistake is. Deferred
  2026-09-09.
- **Teacher-set hint threshold** (hint at ≥ 1, ≥ 2, never) per assignment. v3 hints whenever at
  least one problem has a mistake.
- **Live count updates during rework** as an opt-in scaffold for younger students. Deferred to
  avoid the guess-and-check oracle.

## Group review

- **Persistent teacher settings for group formation**: never pair two named students, always
  pair, maximum group size, mix by confidence. Requested 2026-09-09.
- **Group review that starts only when the whole group has arrived** rather than immediately on
  the student's own transition.

## Force submit and pacing

- **Per-student grace extension** (teacher grants one student more time).
- **Force submit at a chosen time** ("hand in at 10:40") rather than now plus one minute.
- **Teacher-adjustable grace length** (30 s, 1 min, 2 min) per class.

## Data and platform

- **Multi-student student store** keyed per student; the classroom store is already shaped for
  it. Needed before any of the above runs with a real class.
- **Ink rendering in the history compare view** and in the teacher's original-vs-final view
  (with the student's consent setting), now that strokes are persisted.

## UI copy

- **Add descriptions back selectively.** v3 strips every screen to the copy rule in spec2. Once
  the terse version has been used, decide screen by screen where a line of explanation earns its
  place (first-run tooltips, an optional "learn more" per screen, teacher onboarding copy).
